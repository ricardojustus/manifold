  Turn a decision the operator can't answer alone into a questionnaire — a Markdown document for
  the person who actually holds the knowledge, filled in async or worked through together. Use
  when the operator asks to "make a questionnaire" or to "ask <person> these questions", and when
  a spec, plan, or design premise lives in a third party's head (a colleague's operator-world
  facts) rather than anywhere you can look up.

Turn something the operator can't answer alone into a **questionnaire** — a Markdown document they hand to one person to fill in async, or fill out together over a meeting. The recipient holds knowledge the operator lacks; the questionnaire pulls it out of them.

**Grill the send, not the subject.** Interview the operator only about the _send_, which they can always answer: who it goes to, and what they need back. The questions in the document then target the **gap** between what the recipient knows and what the operator needs.

1. **Who is it going to?** Ask, in one exchange, the recipient's role, expertise, and relationship to the operator. This fixes the questionnaire's tone and how much context it must carry. Done when you know who the recipient is and what they know that the operator doesn't.

2. **What do you need back?** Ask, in one exchange, the specific decisions or facts the operator can't resolve alone and needs from this person. Done when you have a concrete list of what the operator must walk away able to do or decide.

3. **Write the questionnaire.** Draft questions aimed at the gap from steps 1–2, following the Document structure below. Write it to `to-questionnaire-<slug>.md` (slug from the topic) where the invoking context says deliverables go — the project binding names the concrete home — and report the path. Done when the file exists and every item the operator named in step 2 is covered by a question.

## Document structure

Frame the document as a **discovery questionnaire**: the operator lacks context, the recipient holds it. Order questions most-important-first — async means you may only get one pass — and group them under `##` headings by theme once there are more than a handful. Write it using the template below.

<questionnaire-template>

# <Questionnaire title>

**Purpose:** why this questionnaire exists and the decision riding on it.

**From:** <the operator> — **To:** <the recipient> — **How your answers will be used:** <where they go>

## Context

One paragraph orienting a recipient who wasn't in the operator's head. Enough to answer well, not a page.

## How to answer

Deadline and rough effort. Partial answers and "I don't know" are useful — flag anything you're unsure of rather than skipping it.

## <Theme heading>

One `##` section per theme. Under each, its questions, most-important-first. Every question is one idea — never compound — with an answer stub directly beneath, and a one-line _why this matters_ only where the question could be misread or invite a throwaway answer.

<question-example>
### What load is the system expected to handle at launch?

_Why this matters: it decides whether we provision for burst traffic now or defer it._

</question-example>

## Anything else?

A closing catch-all: anything we didn't ask that we should know?
